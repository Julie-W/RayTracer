# RayTracer

Started writing a RayTracer from scratch. Uses Bazel to build the project.

- Display generic shapes (e.g. sphere, plane, ..)
- Display .obj files
- PointLight + AreaLight
- BoundingBoxes to make more efficient
- Takes a .txt file as input, describing the objects in the scene and the lighting
